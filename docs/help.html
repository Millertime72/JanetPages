<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>This is the interface you will use to complete your hunt throughout the neighbourhood. You can enter the following commands into the subject line of an email:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>puzzle [cache] check [solution]</b> - Use this to check your solution.</li>
<li><b>puzzle [cache] hint</b> - Use this to get a hint when you're stuck.</li>
<li><b>puzzle [cache] skip</b> - Use this to skip to the next cache if you can't crack a puzzle. (Feel mildly ashamed).</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure to always start the command with the word "puzzle", or you won't get a response. Always put your commands in the <u>subject line</u>, not the body, of the email. If the system doesn't understand what you mean, you will recieve this help message, so pay attention to formatting.<p>
<p>Use the following command to start your hunt!</p>
<p><b>puzzle 1 check kermit</b><p>
<p>P.S. If you find a cache damaged or unusable, please send an email <u>without the subject line "puzzle"</u>. Tell us what's wrong in the email, and we'll come out and fix it. In the meantime, feel free to use the "skip" command to continue your hunt. (In this case feel no shame).<p>
